    <p id="right">The AMD Ryzen 7 4700U is a processor for thin and light laptops based on the Renoir architecture. The
        4700U integrates all eight cores based on the Zen 2 microarchitecture. They are clocked at 2 (guaranteed base
        clock) to 4.1 GHz (Turbo) without SMT / Hyperthreading support (8 threads). The chip is manufactured on the
        modern 7 nm TSMC process and partly thanks to it AMD advertises a 2x improved performance per Watt for the
        Renoir chips. Compared to the faster R7 4800U, the 4700U offers slightly lower clock speeds and no support for
        SMT / Hyperthreading.

        Due to the missing SMT and slightly lower boost clock, the Ryzen 7 4700U should be a bit slower than the Ryzen 7
        4800U (fastest 15W model at launch). Therefore, it should still beat the Intel Core i7-1065G7 (Ice Lake, 4
        cores, 3.9 GHz) in multi-threaded loads easily. The single core performance should be similar (as the 4800U is
        4% faster compared to the i7 in Cinebench R20 according to AMD). Therefore, the R7 4700U is one of the fastest
        15W processors, if the cooling of the laptop is sufficient.

        In addition to the eight CPU cores, the APU also integrates a Radeon RX Vega 7 integrated graphics card with 7
        CUs and up to 1600 MHz. The dual channel memory controller supports DDR4-3200 and energy efficient LPDDR4-4266
        RAM. Furthermore, 8 MB level 3 cache can be found on the chip. See our hub page on the Renoir Processors for
        more information.</p>
